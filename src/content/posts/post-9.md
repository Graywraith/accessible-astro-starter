## Implement Tagging

### Looking to add a tags page and to allow filtering by tag

This template does not implement Tagging, listing and searching via the blog tags. So as the Astro tutorial did implement this feature I figured I would try and implement this.

The process has been quite straight forward as the Astro tutorial provided the bulk of the example code needed to provide this feature.

### Tailwind

Really need to add a callout to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) which rapidly provided all the display classes and enabled me to produce a look I am very happy with.
