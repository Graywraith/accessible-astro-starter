### Climate change and the Gulf Stream

---
So what is the AMOC and how is it related to the Gulf Stream and thus climate change?

[Met Office description of the AMOC](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/oceans/amoc)

Since my time at university studying Ecology I have been interested in climate change. Especially the process which keeps us warmer than other places at the same latitude (I never liked being cold). So for example: Minsk, Belarus, Hamburg, Copenhagen.

I feel sure that the knowledge that climate change might make us colder - at least in the short to medium term ie 10 to 100 years - is going to come as a surprise to many in the UK.

Given that this is a BIG topic I think an on-going narrative is the way to go, with the aim of explaining what exactly the AMOC is, its relationship to the Gulf Stream and the localized climatic effects for the UK.
