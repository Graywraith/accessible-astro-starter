## Well after a long hiatus I have got back to developing my site

### Delete all my fossil oak site and start again?

I started with the intention of dumping my whole original website [Fossil Oak](https://fossiloak.co.uk/). However after reviewing the content (and presentation) decided it was already so comprehensive - although not complete, that if I did so it would never get replaced. So... here we are, a site which at the moment is focused on the blog section of my profile. I intend that this should be much more content focused, although I have already got side tracked trying to a little umph by adding a spice into the content section.

So a new start and try at least to add a bit of narrative every week so. This week finished of decorating the hall and stairs and spent some time in the garden. Not felt so good though so steady away.
