### Some random thoughts and updates

Well to start it occurred to me I have followed the **Noake** surname - my surname - back through my history and the meaning of the Surname. But ignored the female line, the Hansons and Bryans and beyond. Of course this is more complicated as names - the things we use to tag these links - change over time. So I think this is a project to pursue at a latter date.

Next some thoughts on the recent completion of the **Projects** section. Given how dynamic and straight forward the blog section was it seemed that the best way to was to add projects to the collection section in the Astro environment. Again it proved a productive process.

It must be noted that the whole purpose of this site is to keep learning, to document my thoughts is only secondary. So development of the Projects site continued my learning Markdown journey, adding and sizing images.
