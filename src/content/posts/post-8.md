## Mid January 2023. Just got back from a great walk listening to Pavaroti

### It just made me realise how lucky I have been to live at this exact point in the 20th Century.

- At a time when the World war was over, and no other (affecting me at least) was started. UKRAINE! What to say?

- When we have an free to the end user health service - NHS.
  
- I grew up listening to [Beethoven's 5th piano concerto](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=beethoven+5th+piano+concerto+arturo+rubinstien&view=detail&mid=F7BA4EA0FE6162AED355F7BA4EA0FE6162AED355&FORM=VIRE) on dads mega HiFi.

- The Eagles recorded [Hotel California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVsbvFkhzY4)
and [Neil Young](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=aunVlekXjkE&list=PLT8LeN8XJgVZGfJBjGcGvdBM3-e1lzGWA) was arround to produce his epic catalog.

- [Pavarotti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUKgN-nC93c) was still alive and could produce this!
  
- [Whispering Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Harris) got me into [Jackson Browne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ROK1-VvOQ0)

- The [Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rigby)

- That there existed an [educational system](https://leedscitycollege.ac.uk/campuses/joseph-priestley-centre-beeston/) that could take a middle aged man without qualifications and provide him with a first at [University](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/i078/ecology-and-conservation-biology-mbiol-bsc)
