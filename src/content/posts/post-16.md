#### Why Nature is core to my beliefs
As I look back on life the common theme is circularity (hence the infinity icon for this thread)
I look back to being in Friends of the Earth before we moved to Wales to try 'Self Sufficiency', then multiple allotments. Its all about surrounding yourself with life.
[12-06-23] Bit of an update - changed gardening to nature in the title, still casting around to get across my meaning.
Respecting life, is this planet the only island of life in this vast universe? If not does it make it any less special?
