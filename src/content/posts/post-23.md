## Issues Updating to Astro 4.n

<br/>

### So why the long gap in blogging?

<br/><br/>
Well, when Astro 4.0 was released there were some improvements to the image handling and a few other enhancements I felt made it worth the effort of upgrading my blog; it turned not to be so easy. Once I had done the upgrade my pages were there but were blank! The text was in my code but did not display. I tried backtracking, tried to bug fix and so on, all to no avail.
<br/><br/>
Turns out that the upgrade coincided with Tailwinds upgrade to V4.

### Tailwind 4.0

So it turns out the Tailwind upgrade was pretty major and required quite a lot of configuration changes which I completely missed. So... I decided to start again using a different template. So this was not the quick fix I expected. Mainly due to issues getting the functionality I was looking for with some basic styling and Astro V4.n readiness.
<br/><br/>
Several attempts later I ended up with this template into which I have transferred all my content. There have been other enhancements to make and there still is much to do before this site will go live and replace the 'live' content.
The template used was [The Accesable Astro Starter](https://astro.build/themes/details/accessible-astro-starter/).
<br/><br/>
As usual my time is taken up by enhancements and display; rarely content creation. So its back to the code! And lets get this site live again :)
