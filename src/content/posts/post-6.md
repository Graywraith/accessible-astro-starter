## Now what is this for?

## So it occurred to me why am I putting all this effort into re-developing my website - no one ever sees it

Well the primary reason was I felt my original site was getting too 'style' heavy, content light. Also at my age, approaching seventy seven, dementia's many forms haunt your days.

Learning a new language Astro in this instance - although its probably more a CMS (content management system). Still its good for the brain to learn new things. So... primary reason just for the fun of it and to learn new things.

Astro seemed a good fit as it  provided a way to build into a site a blog with a mechanism to update the site as it develops. Here I must shout out the excellent [tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) on Astro after which you end up with a working site / blog.

### I am also learning Markdown in the process
