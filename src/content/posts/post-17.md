### A month gone by without a word, why?

---
Well it turns out I have been ill for the last month. (Started on Monday 26th June) Mostly at home in bed but also with a 12 hour trip to A&E and an overnight in hospital. Seems like I had a leaking artery, caused by a racking cough which seemed to me like Covid even though tested negative twice.

Anyway improving albeit slowly.

So enough for now.
