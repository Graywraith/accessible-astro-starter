### Building a simple but stylish bird table and nest box

So as our many nest boxes have mostly been occupied this year so I thought a handy little project to use up offcuts could be to put together a simple but stylish nest-box / bird-table to pass on to Jonathan. This is the result.

I kept it simple but tried to make reasonably stylish. Providing a stylish finish for the roof is probably the biggest issue. In this version I used roofing felt cut to look like tiles.

Finished and installed May 2023.
