### Re-developing my website and blog via a new section

---

So projects... I figure my latest projects are really all to do with this website. Creation of blogs, formatting content etc. A major project will have to be making this page have dynamic not hard coded lists of the latest Blog and Projects.

The majority of the content is now coming via Markdown files, with display handled by re-usable components. So even for a personal blog far more productive.

Tags are implemented for the blogs section but it would be nice to add that for projects. Also to add is a methodology for theming.
