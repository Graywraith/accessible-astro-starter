<h1 class="text-3xl font-italic">The ongoing project of updating my site. </h1>

<br/>
<p class="text-lg">What was intended as a simple quick easy update to my live site as version 3 of Astro became more a rather more extensive project. This was due to the decision to update all the dependence's at the same time, mainly I think the Tailwind CSS version which had a major update around this time.

<p>So... start again, display at least content copied over. This project, or at least this part of the project was / is down to getting the project content section working! More to come.<p>
