 # Using a React Avatar Component

## So after a few attempts  working Avatar and Menu

I have added an Avatar to my Navbar to give access to a few little traveled area's of my site. I first tried several tailwind components but could not get consistent interactivity behavior however a react component has fixed this issue and gives me more experience with this technology.

More to come! The next step is to implement links in the dropdown menu and change the icons.

Following this there is a cool carousel I plan on using in my projects section to enhance the narrative there.
