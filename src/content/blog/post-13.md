### Implementing Light and Dark Themes for the Site

---

## Much of the CSS styling required is present in Tailwind

So the template I started with when developing my new site already included links to the style library 'Tailwind'. It also had a link to to the Tailwind add-on Daisy UI which provides a load of pre developed themes. So easy, just toggle it on and off, it's just never that easy. Anyway its finally done and finished and I'm happy with the result.

## Garden

It's taken much longer as the garden is taking all my time at the moment.
Tomatoes roaring away as is the lettuce.

Happy Days :)
