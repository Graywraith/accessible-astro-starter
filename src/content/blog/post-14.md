### A new Markdown Snippet

---
There is quite a bit of boilerplate text creating the fenced header content, so I figured I could speed it up with a snippet.

What a great little time saver!
And it works - great.

I'm sure there is more I can do to improve it, but it's great as it is.

Next, same again for the projects section...
