          So where to start? It's arbitary, but I figure the <a

          Europeans made several attempts at

          this could have been our jump off point, but lets just acknowledge that we must be decendents of a cohort that
          traveled up through Africa and made its way into Europe, surviving into the major pinch point of the Last
          Glacial Maximum.

          Now lets take into account my <a

          was cooperative. Why believe in cooperation? Well Neanderthal groups were certainly <a

          Tribes encountered at these most difficult of times cooperated in order to survive, forming bonds and relationships
          Think on this, during the worst of this arround 26000 years ago, the population of EUROPE fell to arround

          had to have or we wouldn't be here! I like to think this was due to cooperation within and between groups.
